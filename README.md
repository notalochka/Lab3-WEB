# Lab3-WEB

These are mini projects that were created as part of the "Web programming" course at the university in the second year of study.

The site presents the first welcome page and inforn=mation about an author of the website. There are other pages with favorite food, movies and places traveled by the authors. 
The website is created only to acquire and practice skills in web programming using CSS and HTML

# Postal version
A new instance of the website has been created according to the mailing list. The basis is a page created on tables, because this layout method is the most adaptive of all methods.
# Example of the postal version of the site:

# Mobile version
A new instance of the website was created according to the option for comfortable use of the web page on a smartphone, while saving the content. To accomplish the task, a new version was created, which is completely written in GridCSS.
The main changes to the website, for the mobile version:
• Placement of blocks shifted. The left blue column is after the main site content and before the footer.
• Removed empty spacing between columns in the footer for more efficient use of space on the site
• Links to other pages in the menu are in the form of a list and are highlighted by aligning the text on the right side
• Changing font sizes and adding new indents in different site blocks
