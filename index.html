            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              I was born on the 27th of October in 2004 in the town of
              Kropyvnytskyi. My mum used to say that I was independent and
              purposeful as a child, although I don't know if I have these
              qualities now. However, this ambitious girl would never have
              thought that she would study programming. My thoughts about a
              career varied from teacher to lawyer. But one thing I knew for
              sure was that I never wanted to be a doctor. I don't like biology
              and chemistry...
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I realise that entering Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic
              Institute was one of the best choices I have made in my life. Yes,
              studying here is difficult, you have to find lots of new
              information yourself... But there is no comparison with how many
              wonderful people you can meet here, how many cool teachers you can
              learn from, how much fun it is to be a student here. I think this
              is where I fit in.

              thought that she would study at KPI and learn programming!
